                    This month, we are excited to share the story of Joshua, a ten-year-old boy who found a new beginning with us. Joshua came to our home after losing his parents and struggling with feelings of abandonment and fear. Thanks to your contributions, we have been able to offer Joshua a safe and loving environment, along with the support he needs to heal and grow.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-secondary">
                    "The children's home has become my family," Joshua says with a smile. "Here, I have friends to play with and people who care about me. I feel safe and happy again."
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-secondary">
                    Stories like Joshua's are a testament to the profound impact your donations have. Every contribution, whether big or small, helps us provide food, education, healthcare, and emotional support to children who need it most.
